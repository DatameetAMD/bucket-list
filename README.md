# Open Ahmedabad

The idea behind the initiative is to maintain open (public) data and make it available to build some amazing tools out of it.

The different ideas and requests regarding open data are tracked under the [issues](https://github.com/DatameetAMD/bucket-list/issues) section of this repository.

The projects under this initiative are maintained [here](https://github.com/orgs/DatameetAMD/projects)

Kindly follow the threads of your interests for any further updates or discussions.

## Contributing

It is an open source community. Anyone can contribute here. To be an official collaborator drop an email to [jimishio](mailto:jimishparekh123@gmail.com?subject=Regarding contribution in Open Ahmedabad). You can always fork the reporitories in this orgranization to resolve issues or make new contribution and submit pull request to merge it.

We considered starting the projects using simple HTML5 webpages and a light usage of bootstrap framework. Do consult us before you start contributing for appropriate assignments of tasks and better understanding of the architecture.

You can also contribute feeding data into any of the ongoing projects here. You can go to the project website and start uploading data or you can upload raw files on the repositories. We insist on opening an issue (or disucssing in a appropriate existing issue) before you upload any raw file. If possible, developer contributors may be able to make a UI for it to upload and parse the data easily.

## Further help

Teams at Open Ahmedabad are always happy to help in various aspects. If you come across any issue or suggestions or (if you're non-tech person) suggestions or any support from developer's team, drop us an email or open an issue on github.

*(Please look up the existing issues before you submit a new one. You might find a relavent or duplicate issue. Adding unnecessary issues will slow down the development process.)*
